  <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

  <p>The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USE</strong>
  <p>In some other companies this ring is called Adopt. It should contain technologies that are proven on the projects and that we’re fully confident that will bring us benefits in our everyday work. These are also technologies that we support and promote, even recommend to other (backend) development teams.
  Some of the technologies in this ring may have some constraints/limitations which have been revealed through the evaluate phase, and those should be clearly stated, i.e. not all technologies in the Use ring can be used for all the projects.</p>

  <p>Important thing to remember is that technologies in the Use ring can become abandoned, e.g. some libraries that were proven and used may become obsolete or outdated . In that case, technology moves to Abandon, but it can still be used in older projects (we also remove it from the Showcase app). If the technology/library/etc is at some later stage updated, upgraded or “refreshed” in any way it can be reevaluated.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>EVALUATE</strong>
  <p>Technology worth of assessment should reside in this ring. The goal of the evaluation is to answer the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>First of all, try and understand if the technology can be used</li>
      <li>what are the advantages</li>
      <li>What are the disadvantages</li>
      <li>Can it applicable to all the projects</li>
      <li>What benefits does the technology bring to projects where it can be applied</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>This phase should be done through research and development and the end result should have answers to the questions above i.e. is the technology moving to Use (and are there any constraints), or is it going to Abandon (with clear answer why it should be abandoned). Also, if there are too many uncertainties or dependencies, the technology can be moved to reconsider but it is important to have documentation on why and when it could be taken into evaluation again. E.g. if technology has some dependencies that were found during the evaluation, as soon as the dependencies are met it can be reevaluated.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>RECONSIDER</strong>
  <p>Technologies that went through the Evaluation and didn’t satisfy, but still may have potential in the future can reside in the Reconsider ring. Here are some examples of why the technology could be in the reconsideration stage:
    <ul>
      <li>Technology seems promising but we’re missing some prerequisites on the projects that we plan to introduce in the near future</li>
      <li>Technology satisfied most of our evaluation criteria, but we’re not sure if it convenient for the high load applications so we want to wait and see whether it is stable enough</li>
      <li>Technology is in beta, evaluation phase looked promising but we want to make sure that main release is stable enough</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</li>

<li><strong>ABANDON</strong>
  <p>Once the technology, for any reason, is not fit for the future projects it becomes abandoned. Synonym for this is Hold ring. As mentioned earlier, abandoned technologies can be present in older projects, but should never be used for anything new. If there is a chance / maintenance period on a project this technology can be replaced by the new solution. Reasons for abandoning technology can be various - from packages that are not maintained anymore, security risks, new and better technologies that can replace the old ones to the upgrade in the protocols that results in improved technology. Abandoned technology is removed from the Showcase app.</p>
</li>

</ul>

  <h3>Quadrants (categories)</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Methods & Patterns &mdash; coding methods and patterns, e.g. DDD, TDD, CQRS</li>
    <li>Tools & vendor libraries &mdash; all the tools that we’re using for development, data monitoring and CI/CD, e.g. PHPStorm, Postman, ELK stack, Sentry, etc and vendor libraries that are common on the projects. We can look at the vendor libraries as tools integrated in the codebase.</li>
    <li>Storages &mdash; any type of data storage, e.g. relational databases, buckets, cache mechanism, …</li>
    <li>Infrastructure &mdash; services / cloud solutions used for any type of infrastructure hosting and other application requirements (such as mailing service, queue management tools, etc)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

  <p>
  The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at Undabot to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
